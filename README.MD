# Description:
This project was here to build my resume and reinforce my knowledge as a self taught developer who can learn about new technology. This website is using Node.js and Express.js. Although I do a lot of backend development at work, I try to be as all rounded as possible by trying some front end development and this is my first attempt at front end web development.
