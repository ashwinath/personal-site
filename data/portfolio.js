    description: 'My first major project during my free time as a student. One of the biggest milestones I crossed since I was not formally trained as a computer scientist/developer. This app loads movies sorted according to popular, highest rated and upcoming movies. It allows you to watch trailers, read reviews and favourite the movie for later use. This was inspired by Udacity\'s Android Developer Nanodegree programme.',
